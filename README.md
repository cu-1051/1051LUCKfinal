My thoughts and concerns on the goal vs the final project:
- My original pplan was more detailed than this, and I am a bit disappointed that I couldn't fulfill the entire vision I had in mind but I feel like I did a good enough job! Before starting this project, I didn't even know how to play agame of blackjack, and I spent quite some time understanding how the game works, what the different roles are, how to win, tips on getting higher chances of winning, and I was able to translate that into code with some research on using the random and turtle modules. I do feel that I could have imporved upon the turtle graphics, and some issues I encountered with it were specifically how to make it run faster and why 'exit on click' wouldn't work for me. Overall, I feel satisfied with what I've achieved not only in this project, but within the class as a whole.
