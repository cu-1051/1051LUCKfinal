"A gambling/luck game similar to the lottery, where you input numbers and randomly get a result,"
"like 123123 would put you in debt, 777777 gives you a million dollars, 000000 means you're evicted with $50 to your name etc"
"and after 5 or so inputs your end situation is compiled into a fun story and you get told what type of luck you have."
"ex: You went deep into debt but won a million dollars, and later got evicted with $50 in your bank account, you have IRONIC luck or something like that"
