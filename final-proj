"""#**Proposal**
## What will likely be the title of your project?
- "Luck of The Draw" or something similar

"A gambling/luck game similar to the lottery, where you input numbers and randomly get a result,"
"like 123123 would put you in debt, 777777 gives you a million dollars, 000000 means you're evicted with $50 to your name etc"
"and after 5 or so inputs your end situation is compiled into a fun story and you get told what type of luck you have."
"ex: You went deep into debt but won a million dollars, and later got evicted with $50 in your bank account, 
you have IRONIC luck or something like that"

## In just a sentence or two summarize your project.
- "Luck of the draw" is a gambling/lottery based game that depends on user inputs. (Considering a card drawing game as well)

## In a paragraph or more, detail your project. What will your software do? What features will it have? How will it be executed?
- "Luck of the Draw" takes various aspects from lottery games, gambling games, blackjack etc., that gives the user a chance to win
or lose mainly by random. The software should take user inputs, randomize an output (of which the odds change due to what is inputted)
and return a result to the user determining if they've won or lost. It should have text and visal graphics. It will be executed 
through renpy or IDLE.

##In the world of software, most everything takes longer to implement than you expect. And so it's not uncommon to 
accomplish less in a fixed amount of time than you hope. 

##In a sentence (or list of features), define a GOOD outcome for your final project. 
I.e., what WILL you accomplish no matter what? 
- Software that takes user input, randomizes an output, and finishes the game by letting user know they have won or lost.

##In a sentence (or list of features), define a BETTER outcome for your final project. 
I.e., what do you THINK you can accomplish before the final project's deadline? 
- Comprehensive software that takes user inputs, randomizes outputs, returns them to the user and allows the user to interact
while also finishing the game letting the user know if they won or lost. May have graphics.

##In a sentence (or list of features), define a BEST outcome for your project. 
What do you HOPE to accomplish before the final project's deadline? 
- I hope to accomplish an interesting and refreshing lottery/gambling game that isn't predictable. Software that runs 
all the way through with minimal errors, returning the output to the user. May have graphics.

##In a paragraph or more, outline your next steps. What new skills will you need to acquire? 
What topics will you need to research? If working with one of two classmates, who will do what?
- Skills I need to acquire/brush up on: programming functions using for and while loops, debugging my own programs
working throuhg the knots in my code and seeking help/assistance when necessary. I'll need to research other 
luck/lottery/gambling based games like BlackJack to understand my goal fully. I'm not working with others.
